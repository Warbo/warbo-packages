# Warbo's Nix Packages #

A hodge podge of packages for [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) which either aren't
yet in the official nixpkgs repository, or are otherwise hacked/overridden.

These aren't expected to remain stable, so if you're going to use them it's
recommended to pin a specific git revision.

Some of these definitions rely on functions from the overlay defined in
http://chriswarbo.net/git/nix-helpers which we'll complain about if not found.
