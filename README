# Warbo's Nix Packages #

A hodge podge of packages for [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) which either aren't
yet in the official nixpkgs repository, or are otherwise hacked/overridden.

These aren't expected to remain stable, so if you're going to use them it's
recommended to pin a specific git revision.

This repository forms part of an unholy trinity of useful nixpkgs overlays:

 - `http://chriswarbo.net/git/warbo-packages` (this) packages useful software
 - `http://chriswarbo.net/git/nix-helpers` provides useful Nix expressions
 - `http://chriswarbo.net/git/warbo-utilities` provides useful scripts

There's also `http://chriswarbo.net/git/warbo-utilities` which ties them all
together for a NixOS system.
